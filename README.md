# The state of DevOps


This is the repository for my analysis on developer sentiment towards DevOps with the [Stack Overflow 2020 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) data.
Take a look at my [blog post](https://bewagner.net/programming/2021/06/01/stackoverflow-developer-survey/) for the full analysis.


The Python code for the analysis can be found in `Developer survey blog post.ipynb`.
It uses the `pandas` library to transform and visualize the data.
