# The state of DevOps

This is the repository for my analysis on developer sentiment towards DevOps with
the [Stack Overflow 2020 Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) data. Take a look at
my [blog post](https://bewagner.net/programming/2021/06/01/stackoverflow-developer-survey/) for the full analysis.

The Python code for the analysis can be found in `Developer survey blog post.ipynb`. It uses the `pandas` library to
transform and visualize the data. The visualizations for the final blog post are the files `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`
and `plot3.png`.

# Summary of the results

The analysis tries to answer the following questions:

- Do people only recognize the value of DevOps once they have it?
- How does having DevOps impact job satisfaction?
- How does sentiment towards DevOps change with company size?

We see that there is a clear indication that developers recognize DevOps importance once they worked with it. In the
data we analysed, DevOps does not seem to have an impact on job satisfaction. Finally, we see that the majority of
developers see DevOps as an important tool in a modern software organization. Only respondents from companies with less
than ten employees see it as less important.
